<div bxs="hello_world" class="textbox">Welcome aboard! This is Killjoy Inc. An (unfortunately) not real company started by a High Schooler. Nice to meet you, my name is Kyle, though I also go by Killjoy (Kylljoy), or Mrkldrky. I've been needing a place to dump (showcase) projects of mine and I think starting a github page would be the perfect place to do so. Ideally, I'd like to have either an actual webhosting service or (my dream) have a port-forwarded server either running off a single board system (Like a Pi or Chromebook), but both of those require cash, something I am a little strapped for at the moment. So unfortunately, PHP and SQL are no-goes, so this is a site entirely made through JS, CSS, and HTML. It's unfortunate, but I suppose we must all
make sacrifices in the name of bettering ourselves. <br><br> Anyways, this is where you can find some of the projects that I deem acceptable to be released to the public. It may seem empty at first, but that's just because most of my projects are at a 
'nearly done' stage and just need to be compiled or packaged for upload.
<br><br>
Yes, if I release executables, they will probably be .exe files because I don't currently have a working OSX development device. I may release source code alongside the project (C/C++) if re-compiling for OSX is neccessary.</div>
